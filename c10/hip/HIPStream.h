/*
 * Stream pool note.
 *
 * A HIPStream is an abstraction of an actual cuStream on the GPU. HIPStreams
 * are backed by cuStreams, but they use several pools to minimize the costs
 * associated with creating, retaining, and destroying cuStreams.
 *
 * There are three pools per device, and a device's pools are lazily created.
 *
 * The first pool contains only the default stream. When the default stream
 * is requested it's returned.
 *
 * The second pool is the "low priority" or "default priority" streams. In
 * HIP builds there is no distinction between streams in this pool and streams
 * in the third pool (below). There are 32 of these streams per device, and
 * when a stream is requested one of these streams is returned round-robin.
 * That is, the first stream requested is at index 0, the second at index 1...
 * to index 31, then index 0 again.
 *
 * This means that if 33 low priority streams are requested, the first and
 * last streams requested are actually the same stream (under the covers)
 * and kernels enqueued on them cannot run concurrently.
 *
 * The third pool is the "high priority" streams. The third pool acts like
 * the second pool except the streams are created with a higher priority.
 *
 * These pools suggest that stream users should prefer many short-lived streams,
 * as the cost of acquiring and releasing streams is effectively zero. If
 * many longer-lived streams are required in performance critical scenarios
 * then the functionality here may need to be extended to allow, for example,
 * "reserving" a subset of the pool so that other streams do not accidentally
 * overlap the performance critical streams.
 *
 * Note: although the notion of "current stream for device" is thread local
 * (every OS thread has a separate current stream, as one might expect),
 * the stream pool is global across all threads; stream 0 is always stream 0
 * no matter which thread you use it on.  Multiple threads can synchronize
 * on the same stream.  Although the HIP documentation is not very clear
 * on the matter, streams are thread safe; e.g., it is safe to enqueue
 * a kernel on the same stream from two different threads.
